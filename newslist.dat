**Feburary 8, 2022** My package for Density Regression is now publicly available on my <a href="https://github.com/vittorioorlandi/drbart" target="_blank">*GitHub*</a>. The associated paper is below. If you have interesting data, I'd encourage you to see what you can find with the package! There's a lot more than just conditional means out there. 
**January 16, 2022** My paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12259" target="_blank">*Density Regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees*</a> has just been accepted for a student paper award by the ASA Section on Bayesian Statistical Science. I'm looking forward to presenting this work at JSM 2022!
**January 12, 2022** My software package `FLAME` has just received an honorable mention for this year's <a href="https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/awards/john-m-chambers" target="_blank">John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award</a>. Thank you to the ASA Sections on Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics for recommending my work! 
**December 22, 2022** My paper *Density Regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees* has just been posted to arXiv! It can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12259" target="_blank">here</a>.
**December 8, 2022** We just presented our demo at NeurIPS 2021! It provides a GUI for matching using algorithms in the AME framework. Check it out <a href="https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/ame-demo" target="_blank">here</a>.
**August 15, 2021** Our paper studying the effects of ABO incompatibility on pediatric cardiac transplants has just been accepted for publication in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery.
**July 15, 2021** I just finished reviewing for *NeurIPS*! Was lucky to have reviewed some great work and am looking forward to seeing more at the conference!
**July 9, 2021** I'm thrilled to have presented my R package `FLAME` at *useR! 2021* in the *Statistical Modeling and Data Analysis* track.
**July 7, 2021** New version of my R package `FLAME` is now up on CRAN! Check it out <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FLAME/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
**May 13, 2021** Excited to start work as an AI Research Intern at <a href="https://www.dataminr.com/" target="_blank">Dataminr</a>, where I'll be building tools to perform real-time sub-event detection from Twitter data.  
**April 27, 2021** Just finished working on a Python package for Fast GP Regression. Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/vittorioorlandi/STA663_FIFA_GP" target="_blank">here</a> and the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06537.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
